This is amazing

Introduction :: 

JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.

language basics :: 

1. Variables
    Variables are the containers where you can Store the value. You can start declaring variable by var keyword at the beginning.

    Imp : JavaScript is Case-sensitive. var helloWorld ==! var helloworld

    Eg:: 
        1. var learning = " JAVASCRIPT "
        2. learning = " SKETCH "

2. Data Types 
    You can store the values in these below different data types 

        1. String :
            A sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, you must enclose it in quote marks.
                Eg: var learning = " JAVASCRIPT "
        2. Number :
            A number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.
                Eg: var learning = 10;
        3. Boolean :
            A True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords in JS, and don't need quotes.
                Eg: var learning = true;
        4. Array : 
            A structure that allows you to store multiple values in one single reference.
                Eg: var learning = ["JavaScript","ReactJs","Python"];
        5. Object :
            Basically, anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object, and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.

    So why do we need variables? Well, variables are needed to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change the image displayed in an image gallery.

3. Comments 
    Comments will be helpful in the future understanding of the code or the process. 
    You can add comments in /* */ or in // way. 

4. Operators 
    An Operator is a mathematical Symbol which produce a result between the values  

        1. Addition Eg: var health = 100 + 90;
        2. Subtraction, Multiplication, Division Eg: var h = 100-10; var h = 100 * 10; var h = 100/10;
        3. Assigment Eg: helloWorld = "Programming"
        4. Equality Eg: var helloWorld ==== "Programming"

5. Conditionals 
    Conditionals are code structures which allow you to test if an expression returns true or not, running alternative code revealed by its result. A very common form of conditionals is the if ... else statement. For example:


6. Functions 
    Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. When you need the procedure you can call a function, with the function name, instead of rewriting the entire code each time. You have already seen some uses of functions above, for example:

7. Events 
    Real interactivity on a website needs events. These are code structures which listen for things happening in browser, running code in response. The most obvious example is the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse. To demonstrate this, enter the following into your console, then click on the current webpage:
